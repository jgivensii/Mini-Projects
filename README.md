# 🧩 Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a curated set of small, self‑contained projects created to explore programming concepts, data analysis techniques, algorithms, automation, and scientific computing. Each mini‑project focuses on a specific idea or skill, serving as a hands‑on way to practice and grow as a developer.

These projects vary in size and complexity — from simple utilities to experimental simulations — and reflect my ongoing learning across multiple languages and problem‑solving domains.
